    "* There were 3 different dates ( the start time of the event, the jointed_at date, the timestamp). I added all time differences between each dates. They were all important.\n",
    "* Additionally I extracted the year, month, day, hour and weekday of each date, but of these features had only a small impact.\n",
    "* I clustered all events using only the c_1, c_2, ..., c_n-features with kmeans (about 30 categories).\n",
    "* I counted how many events each user had in the train/test file (very important feature).\n",
    "* I defined similar users as users, which have about the same age, same timezone and same gender and counted how many of them had a yes/maybe/no/invited for the given event. However, these features had no big impact.\n",
    "* Country was important, too. I only used the 10 most common countries and put all others into the category \"Other\". I did the same for locale and city.\n",
    "* The \"usual\" stuff: Count of yes/maybe/no/invited of all friends and all other users. Lat and lng were very important as well\n",
    "* In the end I had about 60-70 features, which were all more or less important.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all these features I tried to predict the \"interested\"-column and for this I used the probability-output of a gbm. My aim was to minimize the LogLoss-error between my prediction and the actual solution. I never used the MAP-metric, because the lower the LogLoss-error the higher the MAP.\n",
